# Time-efficiency
This project has the domain of AI-ML using OpenNLP. The purpose of this project is to improve the time of processing/analyzing the data in a Prediction system
It has datasets of training and testing as an input of the Prediction System.
The prediction system is developed in java using OpenNLP which uses Naive bais as the algorithm for prediction.
The concept of Parallelism is used in order to fulfill the purpose of the project.
Results are stored in the database.
### Requirements###
      NetBeans IDE Software
      Java 8
      XAMPP Server
      Concepts/ Algorithm of AI-ML
###            ###
Installing NetBeans IDE. 
Installing Java version 7 and above are suitable.
Preparing Dataset for training, testing.
Coding the program for parallel processing of the data to attain parallelism, which is the objective of the project.
Recording the time requires to process the data serially and recording the time required to process the data parallelly are noted.
Storing the results in database, for representation of the results.
